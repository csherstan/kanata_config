This project will consist of a single html file (javascript embedded) that will act as a configuration visualizer for the kanata project. The document describing the configuration can be found here: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/blob/v1.10.0/docs/config.adoc

The html file has the following behavior:
- allows the user to load an existing file
- shows keyboard visualization with mappings
- shows different layers
- allows the user to create custom mappings and layers
- allow the user to generate and save a new configuration based on the current set up that they've created in the html page.
